*markdown-link* Plugin to make markdown files behave like a wiki

It will make it easy to use Headers as "ancors" that words can link to.  With
:GenerateWikiLink every header you have will become a new keyword, so it will
be highlighted like "Label"

If you use the command :FollowWord it will search for an header which title is
the same of the word under your cursor
